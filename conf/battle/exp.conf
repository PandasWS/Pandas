// Setting this can cap the max experience one can get per kill specified as a
// % of the current exp bar. (Every 10 = 1.0%)
// For example, set it to 500 and no matter how much exp the mob gives, 
// it can never give you above half of your current exp bar.
max_exp_gain_rate: 0

// Method of calculating earned experience when defeating a monster:
// 0 = uses damage given / total damage as damage ratio
// 1 = uses damage given / max_hp as damage ratio
// NOTE: Using type 1 disables the bonus where the first attacker gets 
//       his share of the exp doubled when multiple people attack the mob.
exp_calc_type: 0

// Experience increase per attacker. That is, every additional attacker to the
// monster makes it give this much more experience
// (eg: 5 people attack with 25 here, +(25*4)% -> +100% exp)

// Max number of attackers at which exp bonus is capped
// (eg: if set at 5, the max bonus is 4*bonus-per-char regardless of attackers)

// The rate of exp. that is gained by the process of resurrection, a unit is 0.01%.
// Experience calculations for the experience value * level difference of the person revived / 100 * resurrection_exp/10000 which the revived player has can be got.
resurrection_exp: 0

// The rate of job exp. when using discount and overcharge on an NPC
// (in 0.01% increments - 100 is 1%, 10000 is normal, 20000 is double.)
// The way it is calculated is (money received * skill lv) * shop_exp / 10000.
shop_exp: 0

// PVP exp.  Do players get exp in PvP maps
// (Note: NOT exp from players, but from normal leveling)

// through external means (ie: stat point buyers/sellers)
use_statpoint_table: yes

// EXP cost for cast PR_REDEMPTIO (Note 2)
exp_cost_redemptio: 1

// How many player needed to makes PR_REDEMPTIO's EXP penalty become 0?
// If by default, the 'exp_cost_redemptio' is 1 (1%) and every single player revived the penalty is reduced to 0.2%,
// it means 'exp_cost_redemptio_limit' is 5.
